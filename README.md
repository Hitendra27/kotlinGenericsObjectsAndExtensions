# Kotlin Generics, Objects, and Extension Functions
This repository contains examples and explanations of Kotlin generics, objects, and extension functions.

## Generics
Explore how generics in Kotlin enable writing reusable and type-safe code by allowing types to be parameterized. Examples demonstrate how generics can be used in functions, classes, and interfaces.

## Objects
Discover the power of Kotlin's object keyword, which allows the creation of singleton instances, companion objects, and anonymous objects. Learn how to use objects effectively to organize code and implement design patterns.

## Extension Functions
Learn about Kotlin's extension functions, which enable adding new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code. Examples showcase how extension functions can enhance readability, code reuse, and the expressiveness of Kotlin code.

## How to Use
Clone the repository and explore the code examples provided. Each directory contains Kotlin source files with detailed comments explaining the concepts and usage of generics, objects, and extension functions.

Feel free to contribute additional examples or improvements via pull requests. Happy coding!
